# basic-Ecommerce-cart

Through this project, I have learnt about the concept of lists in Data structure and
performed various operations on it through a code implemented in Python programming
language.
• I have performed various operations in the cart like adding the items and then
calculating their prices and then providing the total of the prices
• Once the items are added successfully, the code automatically sorts the items according
to the alphabetical order of the names of items
